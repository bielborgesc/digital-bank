# :bank: Digital Bank
## :mag: Objective
This work done during my graduation had the main objective of learning how the Oracle database works. Through this repository, it is possible to learn a little more about **[Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/database/)**, the PL/SQL language, and a bit about [**MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/) (non-relational database).

## :computer: Development
This development is composed of 3 parts:
* [**Part** 1](https://github.com/bielborgesc/digital-bank/tree/main/Part-1) - The database modeling, along with the description of the main motivation behind this modeling. Below we can see an image that describes how the database modeling turned out:

* In this stage, we also have 3 different users: **System** (responsible for granting permissions to users), **gabrielb** (Responsible for creating the initial schema structure and performing the first population), and **user** (who has restricted permissions and can view the system's tables).
* [**Part 2**](https://github.com/bielborgesc/digital-bank/tree/main/Part-2) In this stage, we have the logs and the dump file (binary with the objects and their structures) generated from Part 1.
* [**Part 3**](https://github.com/bielborgesc/digital-bank/tree/main/Part-3) In this last stage, we see a little about **MongoDB** and its functioning by performing CRUD operations.

## :heavy_check_mark: Concluding
This college work demonstrates basic principles for working with databases. It is possible to see the modeling of a database, how to create, update, view, and delete data and tables, grant permissions to different users, and see the difference in coding from a relational to a non-relational database.

## :arrow_forward: Run the code
You can execute the scripts from parts 1 and 2 on any DBMS that supports Oracle, I suggest [SQL Developer](https://www.oracle.com/tools/downloads/sqldev-downloads.html), and to execute part 3, I suggest [MongoDB Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
